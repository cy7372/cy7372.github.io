  <p>
    I am currently a postgraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, focusing on artificial intelligence for oceanography. My research centers on developing multi-task intelligent perception models, with an emphasis on practical, application-driven solutions for scientific and engineering challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, I address issues of low-resource scenarios and annotation quality in real-world AI systems. My experience spans remote sensing imagery, underwater embodied perception, and AI4Science, where I aim to develop effective solutions for complex and data-limited environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to my postgraduate studies, I conducted research in the TSMC Lab on deep learning for code analysis and intelligence. While my recent projects have focused on marine and underwater applications, I am open to broader AI challenges beyond this field.
  </p>
  # <p>
  #   I expect to graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking PhD positions in artificial intelligence, oceanography, or underwater engineering.
  # </p>

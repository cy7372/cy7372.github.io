  <p>
    My research currently focuses on AI for Science, specifically within the marine domain. My work involves applications such as marine remote sensing, meteorological monitoring, and underwater robotics. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in data-driven deep learning methods for industry-specific scenarios. I address challenges like data scarcity and annotation noise through expertise in multimodal perception modeling, automated data-construction pipelines, transfer learning, and data synthesis. This has resulted in the development of multiple deployable, task-specific models.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to my postgraduate studies, I conducted research on deep learning for code analysis and intelligence at the Trusted Software and Intelligent Computing Lab. I also received multiple national-level awards in AI competitions, which significantly enhanced my expertise in model design and engineering.
  </p>
